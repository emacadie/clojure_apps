Create db the old-fashioned way:
sudo -u postgres psql postgres

create user shouter_dev with password 'dev-word-to-pass001';
create database shouter_db_dev with owner shouter_dev;
grant all privileges on database shouter_db_dev to shouter_dev;
Don't forget this:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE shouter_db_dev from public;

From cli:
This does not work:
psql -h localhost -U shouter_dev -d shouter_db_dev
This does:
psql -h localhost  -d shouter_db_dev

CLI, run: lein deps

lein repl
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as sql])
(def db-spec 
  {:classname "org.postgresql.Driver"
   :subprotocol "postgresql"
   :subname "//127.0.0.1:5432/shouter_db_dev"
   :user "shouter_dev"
   :password "dev-word-to-pass01"})

This just returns the command to create a table, it does not actually do it.
(sql/with-db-connection [db-con db-spec]
    (sql/create-table-ddl :testing [:data :text]))

This works:
(sql/db-do-commands "postgresql://localhost:5432/shouter_db_dev"
    (sql/create-table-ddl :testing2 [:data :text]))

Should it? (It did before I removed public access)
Now, to get rid of those tables;
(sql/db-do-commands db-spec
  (sql/with-db-connection [db-con db-spec]
    (sql/drop-table-ddl :testing2 )))
Or just:
(sql/db-do-commands db-spec
    (sql/drop-table-ddl :testing2 ))
First I had to go in as main user:
sudo -u postgres psql shouter_db_dev
Then: alter table testing2 owner to shouter_dev;

Adding tables:
(sql/with-db-connection [db-con db-spec]
    (sql/drop-table-ddl :testing2 ))
(sql/db-do-commands db-spec
    (sql/drop-table-ddl :testing9 ))
(sql/db-do-commands db-spec
    (sql/create-table-ddl :testing9 [:data :text]))

(sql/insert! "postgresql://localhost:5432/shouter_db_dev"
    :testing {:data "Hello World"})

(sql/query "postgresql://localhost:5432/shouter_db_dev"
    ["select * from testing"])

(sql/db-do-commands "postgresql://localhost:5432/shouter_db_dev"
    "drop table testing")
