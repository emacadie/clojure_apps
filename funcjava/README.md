# funcjava

This is a Clojure app using boot that will have Clojure equivalents to the Java code in Venkat S' Functional Programming in Java.   
I already have a Gradle-based repo that has the Java code and equivalent Groovy code. I found a Gradle plugin that let you use Clojure in a Gradle app,
but I wasn't able to do as much as with lein or boot or Gradle for Java and Groovy (like only run some of the tests).
