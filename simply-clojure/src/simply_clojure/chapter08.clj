;; 8.6  When you're talking to someone over a noisy radio connection, 
;; you sometimes have to spell out a word in order to get the other person to understand it. 
;; But names of letters aren't that easy to understand either, 
;; so there's a standard code in which each letter is represented 
;; by a particular word that starts with the letter. For example, instead of "B" you say "bravo."
;; Write a procedure words that takes a word as its argument and returns a sentence of the names of the letters in the word:
; > (words 'cab)
;; (CHARLIE ALPHA BRAVO)
;; (You may make up your own names for the letters or look up the standard ones if you want.)
;; Hint: Start by writing a helper procedure that figures out the name for a single letter.
;; a map would come in handy here
;; to get the letters of a word:
;; (define (single letter) (word letter))
(def nato-letter-map {:a :alpha, :b :bravo, :c :charlie, :d :delta, :e :echo})

;; Just assume we get a string
(defn letter-count [the-sent]

;; 8.8  [12.5] Write an exaggerate procedure which exaggerates sentences:
;; It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace "good" with "great," "bad" with "terrible," and anything else you can think of.
;; sounds like every with a dash of condx

;; 8.11  [12.6] Write a GPA procedure. It should take a sentence of grades as its argument and return the corresponding grade point average:

;; 3.67

;; Hint: write a helper procedure base-grade that takes a grade as argument and returns 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, 
;; and another helper procedure grade-modifier that returns âˆ’.33, 0, or .33, depending on whether the grade has a minus, a plus, or neither.

;; 8.13  [11.3] Write a procedure phone-unspell that takes a spelled version of a phone number, such as POPCORN, 
;; and returns the real phone number, in this case 7672676. 
;; You will need to write a helper procedure that uses an 8-way cond expression to translate a single letter into a digit.
