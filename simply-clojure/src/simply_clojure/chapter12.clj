;; Most of what follows is from Simply Scheme repo:
;; I did not do tail recursion. But then again, the authors did not mention tail-recursion.
;; I don't think I got it when I did the other Scheme tutorials.
;; But I was able to use loop-recur in Clojure, and I think that is similar to tail-recursion:
;; from https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#recur
;; "recur in other than a tail position is an error."
;; The page also says it is not tail-call optimized, and the only thing to look out for is that you are not using an infinite sequence:
;; "There is no tail-call optimization and the use of self-calls for looping of unknown bounds is discouraged."
;; I wonder if there is a library that can check your recursive calls.

;; In the Shido tutorial, Shido will have a wrapper procedure that calls the tail-recursive procedure.
;; Also, look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13664639/tail-recursive-functions-in-scheme
;; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion

;; A few bits of advice from the text:
;; If your function is supposed to return a number, it must return a number all the time, even in the base case. 
;; You can use this idea to help you check the correctness of the base case expression.
;; One issue is that Scheme and Clojure are not statically typed
;; If your base case doesn't make sense in its own right, it probably means that you're trying to compensate for a mistake in the recursive case.
