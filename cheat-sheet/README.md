# cheat-sheet
This is a project to go through the cheat sheet at http://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet   

Whenever I go through 4Clojure, I always wind up randomly scanning the cheat sheet to try to find something that will solve the problem.   

So then  I thought, why not just  go through the cheat sheet and get familiar with some of the functions?   

Also, per http://realworldclojure.com/one-weird-trick/, I could go through the API page: http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html
